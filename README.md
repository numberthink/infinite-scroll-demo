# Infinite scroll demo

This is a basic demonstration of how to implement an infinite scroll.

It uses the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to add new `div` elements of a random color to the page as the user scrolls down.

The infinite scroll is explored in detail in this [blog post](https://numberthink.com/blog/scrolling-to-infinity).
